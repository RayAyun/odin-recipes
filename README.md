# odin-recipes
This project will be part of my continued learing through The Odin Project.

The Odin Project has inspired me to brush up on what I already knew about HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to learn what I don't know such as React.JS, Node.jS etc.
By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated knowledge on how to structure a HTML document using beginner techniques such as good use of headings, images, links and lists to present information in a clean way to visitors of the webpage. I will also have learned new skills with Git and Github in my journey towards becoming a developer.
